# Uchuu
This repo contains examples to help you getting started processing Uchuu data using Spark in the Hadoop3 platform at CESGA.

## Using the notebooks
To start using the **getting started notebooks** connect to hadoop3.cesga.es using SSH.

Then clone this repo:

    git clone https://github.com/bigdatacesga/uchuu

Go into the new created uchuu dir:

    cd uchuu

And finally start a jupyter-lab session:

    start_jupyter-lab_uchuu

Then just copy the URL into your browser.

When done remember to save and shutdown your notebooks in the web interfaces,
as well as to stop the `start_jupyter-lab_uchuu` session in the command line.
